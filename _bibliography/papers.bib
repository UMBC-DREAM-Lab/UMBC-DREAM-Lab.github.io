  title={Evading Malware Classifiers via Monte Carlo Mutant Feature Discovery},
  author={Boutsikas, John and Eren, Maksim E and Varga, Charles and Raff, Edward and Matuszek, Cynthia and Nicholas, Charles},
  abstract = {The use of Machine Learning has become a significant part of malware detection efforts due to the influx of new malware, an ever changing threat landscape, and the ability of Machine Learning methods to discover meaningful distinctions between malicious and benign software. Antivirus vendors have also begun to widely utilize malware classifiers based on dynamic and static malware analysis features. Therefore, a malware author might make evasive binary modifications against Machine Learning models as part of the malware development life cycle to execute an attack successfully. This makes the studying of possible classifier evasion strategies an essential part of cyber defense against malice. To this extent, we stage a grey box setup to analyze a scenario where the malware author does not know the target classifier algorithm, and does not have access to decisions made by the classifier, but knows the features used in training. In this experiment, a malicious actor trains a surrogate model using the EMBER-2018 dataset to discover binary mutations that cause an instance to be misclassified via a Monte Carlo tree search. Then, mutated malware is sent to the victim model that takes the place of an antivirus API to test whether it can evade detection.},

abstract = {Malware classification using machine learning algorithms is a difficult task, in part due to the absence of strong natural features in raw executable binary files. Byte n-grams previously have been used as features, but little work has been done to explain their performance or to understand what concepts are actually being learned. In contrast to other work using n-gram features, in this work we use orders of magnitude more data, and we perform feature selection during model building using Elastic-Net regularized Logistic Regression. We compute a regularization path and analyze novel {\{}$\backslash$em multi-byte identifiers{\}}. Through this process, we discover significant previously unreported issues with byte n-gram features that cause their benefits and practicality to be overestimated. Three primary issues emerged from our work. First, we discovered a flaw in how previous corpora were created that leads to an over-estimation of classification accuracy. Second, we discovered that most of the information contained in n-grams stem from string features that could be obtained in simpler ways. Finally, we demonstrate that n-gram features promote overfitting, even with linear models and extreme regularization.},

abstract = {Many efforts have been made to use various forms of domain knowledge in malware detection. Currently there exist two common approaches to malware detection without domain knowledge, namely byte n-grams and strings. In this work we explore the feasibility of applying neural networks to malware detection and feature learning. We do this by restricting ourselves to a minimal amount of domain knowledge in order to extract a portion of the Portable Executable (PE) header. By doing this we show that neural networks can learn from raw bytes without explicit feature construction, and perform even better than a domain knowledge approach that parses the PE header into explicit features.},

abstract = {Recent work has shown that byte n-grams learn mostly low entropy features, such as function imports and strings, which has brought into question whether byte n-grams can learn information corresponding to higher entropy levels, such as binary code. We investigate that hypothesis in this work by performing byte n-gram analysis on only specific sub-sections of the binary file, and compare to results ob- tained by n-gram analysis on assembly code generated from disassembled binaries. We do this by leveraging the change in model performance and ensembles to glean insights about the data. In doing so we discover that byte n-grams can learn from the code regions, but do not necessarily learn any new information. We also discover that assembly n-grams may not be as effective as previously thought and that disam- biguating instructions by their binary opcode, an approach not previously used for malware detection, is critical for model generalization.},

abstract = {The Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) has been used in a number of domains to compare objects with varying feature types. This flexibility comes from the use of general purpose compression algorithms as the means of computing distances between byte sequences. Such flexibility makes NCD particularly attractive for cases where the right features to use are not obvious, such as malware classification. However, NCD can be computationally demanding, thereby restricting the scale at which it can be applied. We introduce an alternative metric also inspired by compression, the Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance (LZJD). We show that this new distance has desirable theoretical properties, as well as comparable or superior performance for malware classification, while being easy to implement and orders of magnitude faster in practice.},

In this work, we develop our new SHWeL feature vector representation, by extending the recently proposed Lempel-Ziv Jaccard Distance. These SHWeL vectors improve upon LZJD's accuracy, outperform byte n-grams, and allow us to build efficient algorithms for both training (a weakness of byte n-grams) and inference (a weakness of LZJD). Furthermore, our new SHWeL method also allows us to directly tackle the class imbalance problem, which is common for malware-related tasks. Compared to existing methods like SMOTE, SHWeL provides significantly improved accuracy while reducing algorithmic complexity to O(N). Because our approach is developed without the use of domain knowledge, it can be easily re-applied to any new domain where there is a need to classify byte sequences.},

It is not practical to build an agreed upon test set to benchmark malware detection systems on pure classification performance. Instead we tackle the problem by creating a new testing methodology, where we evaluate the change in performance on a set of known benign {\&} malicious files as adversarial modifications are performed. The change in performance combined with the evasion techniques then quantifies a system's robustness against that approach. Through these experiments we are able to show in a quantifiable way how purely ML based systems can be more robust than AV products at detecting malware that attempts evasion through modification, but may be slower to adapt in the face of significantly novel attacks.},

Despite the unprecedented size ofn considered, we show how these features still have predictive ability for malware classification tasks. More important, large n- grams provide benefits in producing features that are interpretable by malware analysis, and can be used to create general purpose signatures compatible with industry standard tools like Yara. Fur- thermore, the counts of common n-grams in a file may be added as features to publicly available human-engineered features that rival efficacy of professionally-developed features when used to train gradient-boosted decision tree models on the EMBER dataset.},

In this paper, we explore the idea of stochastically combining a large number of individually weak defenses into a single barrage of randomized transformations to build a strong defense against adversarial attacks. We show that, even after accounting for obfuscated gradients, the Barrage of Random Transforms (BaRT) is a resilient defense against even the most difficult attacks, such as PGD. BaRT achieves up to a 24x improvement in accuracy compared to previous work, and has even extended effectiveness out to a previously untested maximum adversarial perturbation of ϵ=32.},

Depending on sophisticated learning algorithms and available data, these systems are increasingly becoming automated and data-driven. However, these systems can impact individuals and communities with ethical or legal consequences. Numerous approaches have therefore been proposed to develop decision making systems that are discrimination-conscious by-design. However, these methods assume the underlying data distribution is stationary without drift, which is counterfactual in many real world applications. In addition, their focus has been largely on minimizing discrimination while maximizing prediction performance without necessary flexibility in customizing the tradeoff according to different applications. To this end, we propose a learning algorithm for fair classification that also adapts to evolving data streams and further allows for a flexible control on the degree of accuracy and fairness. The positive results on a set of discriminated and non-stationary data streams demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of this approach.},

abstract = {With the increased attention on thermal imagery for Covid-19 screening, the public sector may believe there are new opportunities to exploit thermal as a modality for computer vision and AI. Thermal physiology research has been ongoing since the late nineties. This research lies at the intersections of medicine, psychology, machine learning, optics, and affective computing. We will review the known factors of thermal vs. RGB imaging for facial emotion recognition. But we also propose that thermal imagery may provide a semi-anonymous modality for computer vision, over RGB, which has been plagued by misuse in facial recognition. However, the transition to adopting thermal imagery as a source for any human-centered AI task is not easy and relies on the availability of high fidelity data sources across multiple demographics and thorough validation. This paper takes the reader on a short review of machine learning in thermal FER and the limitations of collecting and developing thermal FER data for AI training. Our motivation is to provide an introductory overview into recent advances for thermal FER and stimulate conversation about the limitations in current datasets.},

abstract = {Deep neural networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to subtle adversarial perturbations applied to the input. These adversarial perturbations, though imperceptible, can easily mislead the DNN. In this work, we take a control theoretic approach to the problem of robustness in DNNs. We treat each individual layer of the DNN as a nonlinear dynamical system and use Lyapunov theory to prove stability and robustness locally. We then proceed to prove stability and robustness globally for the entire DNN. We develop empirically tight bounds on the response of the output layer, or any hidden layer, to adversarial perturbations added to the input, or the input of hidden layers. Recent works have proposed spectral norm regularization as a solution for improving robustness against l2 adversarial attacks. Our results give new insights into how spectral norm regularization can mitigate the adversarial effects. Finally, we evaluate the power of our approach on a variety of data sets and network architectures and against some of the well-known adversarial attacks.},

abstract = {Yara rules are a ubiquitous tool among cybersecurity practitioners and analysts. Developing high-quality Yara rules to detect a malware family of interest can be labor- and time-intensive, even for expert users. Few tools exist and relatively little work has been done on how to automate the generation of Yara rules for specific families. In this paper, we leverage large n-grams ({\$}n \backslashgeq 8{\$}) combined with a new biclustering algorithm to construct simple Yara rules more effectively than currently available software. Our method, AutoYara, is fast, allowing for deployment on low-resource equipment for teams that deploy to remote networks. Our results demonstrate that AutoYara can help reduce analyst workload by producing rules with useful true-positive rates while maintaining low false-positive rates, sometimes matching or even outperforming human analysts. In addition, real-world testing by malware analysts indicates AutoYara could reduce analyst time spent constructing Yara rules by 44-86{\%}, allowing them to spend their time on the more advanced malware that current tools can't handle.

abstract = {Prior work inspired by compression algorithms has described how the Burrows Wheeler Transform can be used to create a distance measure for bioinformatics problems. We describe issues with this approach that were not widely known, and introduce our new Burrows Wheeler Markov Distance (BWMD) as an alternative. The BWMD avoids the shortcomings of earlier efforts, and allows us to tackle problems in variable length DNA sequence clustering. BWMD is also more adaptable to other domains, which we demonstrate on malware classification tasks. Unlike other compression-based distance metrics known to us, BWMD works by embedding sequences into a fixed-length feature vector. This allows us to provide significantly improved clustering performance on larger malware corpora, a weakness of prior methods.},

We show a number of techniques that can be used to make a faster and more faithful GPU version of UMAP, and obtain speedups of up to 100x in practice. Many of these design choices/lessons are general purpose and may inform the conversion of other graph and manifold learning algorithms to use GPUs.

As many have begun to work on this problem, all work we are aware of treat the issue of reproducibility as an intrinsic binary property: a paper is or is not reproducible. Instead, we consider modeling the reproducibility of a paper as a survival analysis problem. We argue that this perspective represents a more accurate model of the underlying meta-science question of reproducible research, and we show how a survival analysis allows us to draw new insights that better explain prior longitudinal data.

abstract = {Recent works within machine learning have been tackling inputs of ever-increasing size, with cybersecurity presenting sequence classification problems of particularly extreme lengths. In the case of Windows executable malware detection, inputs may exceed {\$}100{\$} MB, which corresponds to a time series with {\$}T=100,000,000{\$} steps. To date, the closest approach to handling such a task is MalConv, a convolutional neural network capable of processing up to {\$}T=2,000,000{\$} steps. The {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}O{\}}(T){\$} memory of CNNs has prevented further application of CNNs to malware. In this work, we develop a new approach to temporal max pooling that makes the required memory invariant to the sequence length {\$}T{\$}. This makes MalConv {\$}116\backslashtimes{\$} more memory efficient, and up to {\$}25.8\backslashtimes{\$} faster to train on its original dataset, while removing the input length restrictions to MalConv. We re-invest these gains into improving the MalConv architecture by developing a new Global Channel Gating design, giving us an attention mechanism capable of learning feature interactions across 100 million time steps in an efficient manner, a capability lacked by the original MalConv CNN.

@inproceedings{Ordun2020,
abstract = {This paper illustrates five different techniques to assess the distinctiveness of topics, key terms and features, speed of information dissemination, and network behaviors for Covid19 tweets. First, we use pattern matching and second, topic modeling through Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to generate twenty different topics that discuss case spread, healthcare workers, and personal protective equipment (PPE). One topic specific to U.S. cases would start to uptick immediately after live White House Coronavirus Task Force briefings, implying that many Twitter users are paying attention to government announcements. We contribute machine learning methods not previously reported in the Covid19 Twitter literature. This includes our third method, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), that identifies unique clustering-behavior of distinct topics to improve our understanding of important themes in the corpus and help assess the quality of generated topics. Fourth, we calculated retweeting times to understand how fast information about Covid19 propagates on Twitter. Our analysis indicates that the median retweeting time of Covid19 for a sample corpus in March 2020 was 2.87 hours, approximately 50 minutes faster than repostings from Chinese social media about H7N9 in March 2013. Lastly, we sought to understand retweet cascades, by visualizing the connections of users over time from fast to slow retweeting. As the time to retweet increases, the density of connections also increase where in our sample, we found distinct users dominating the attention of Covid19 retweeters. One of the simplest highlights of this analysis is that early-stage descriptive methods like regular expressions can successfully identify high-level themes which were consistently verified as important through every subsequent analysis.},

abstract = {The most prevalent experimental methodology for comparing the effectiveness of information retrieval systems requires a test collection, composed of a set of documents, a set of query topics, and a set of relevance judgments indicating which documents are relevant to which topics. It is well known that relevance judgments are not infallible, but recent retrospective investigation into results from the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) has shown that differences in human judgments of relevance do not affect the relative measured performance of retrieval systems. Based on this result, we propose and describe the initial results of a new evaluation methodology which replaces human relevance judgments with a randomly selected mapping of documents to topics which we refer to aspseudo-relevance judgments.Rankings of systems with our methodology correlate positively with official TREC rankings, although the performance of the top systems is not predicted well. The correlations are stable over a variety of pool depths and sampling techniques. With improvements, such a methodology could be useful in evaluating systems such as World-Wide Web search engines, where the set of documents changes too often to make traditional collection construction techniques practical.},

abstract = {Strong empirical evidence that one machine-learning algorithm A outperforms another one B ideally calls for multiple trials optimizing the learning pipeline over sources of variation such as data sampling, data augmentation, parameter initialization, and hyperparameters choices. This is prohibitively expensive, and corners are cut to reach conclusions. We model the whole benchmarking process, revealing that variance due to data sampling, parameter initialization and hyperparameter choice impact markedly the results. We analyze the predominant comparison methods used today in the light of this variance. We show a counter-intuitive result that adding more sources of variation to an imperfect estimator approaches better the ideal estimator at a 51 times reduction in compute cost. Building on these results, we study the error rate of detecting improvements, on five different deep-learning tasks/architectures. This study leads us to propose recommendations for performance comparisons.},

While alternatives have been developed, the effectiveness, ease of implementation, and theoretical grounding of the K-means++ and ‖ methods have made them difficult to “best” from a holistic perspective. By considering the limited opportunities within seed selection to perform pruning, we develop specialized triangle inequalitypruning strategies and a dynamic priority queue to show the first acceleration of K-Means++ and K-Means‖ that is faster in run-time while being algorithmicly equivalent. For both algorithms we are able to reduce distance computations by over500×. For K-means++ this results in up to a 17×speedup in run-time and a 551× speedup for K-means‖. We achieve this with simple, but carefully chosen, modifications to known techniques which makes it easy to integrate our approach into existing implementations of these algorithms},
